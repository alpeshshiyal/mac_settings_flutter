final String username = userController.text;
final String password = passwordController.text;

isLoading = true;
notifyListeners();

macSettingFlutter.onAuthenticated = () {
  Alerts.showInfoSnackBar("Authenticated successfully!");
  Navigator.of(context).pushNamed(ControlMacPage.routeName);
};

macSettingFlutter.printTrace = (value) {
  debugPrint("print trace: $value");
  Alerts.showInfoSnackBar(value);
};

// Connect to Mac
await macSettingFlutter.connectMac(
  ip: macIp,
  userName: username,
  macPassword: password,
);
